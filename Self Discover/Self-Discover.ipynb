    "# SELF-DISCOVER: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures\n",
    "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03620](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03620)    \n",
    "     \n",
    "Il paper \"**Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures**\" presenta un approccio innovativo per migliorare le capacità di ragionamento dei grandi modelli linguistici (LLMs).    \n",
    "L'approccio, denominato \"*Self-Discover*\" (auto-scoperta, scoperta di se stessi), consente ai modelli di auto-comporre strutture di ragionamento senza dipendere completamente dagli input umani, migliorando la loro capacità di risolvere problemi complessi. I modelli utilizzano una varietà di moduli di ragionamento predefiniti per analizzare e decomporre i problemi, valutare diverse prospettive e generare soluzioni innovative.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Il modello è stato testato su diversi set di dati, inclusi Big Bench-Hard (BBH) e MATH, mostrando miglioramenti significativi rispetto ai metodi tradizionali. Per esempio, nel BBH, il modello Self-Discover ha superato le prestazioni di GPT-4 e PaLM 2-L in molte attività (come riportato nel paper).    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Il metodo Self-Discover apre nuove possibilità per l'automazione del problem-solving in vari settori, migliorando l'autonomia e l'efficacia dei LLMs nella risoluzione di problemi complessi senza la necessità di interventi umani continui, presentando un approccio promettente per l'automazione del ragionamento nei grandi modelli linguistici, con implicazioni potenzialmente significative per il miglioramento delle loro capacità di risoluzione dei problemi e la loro applicabilità in contesti reali.\n",

      "* Relationship Mapping: identify all relationships between actors, taking account of relationships and memberships within, such as family members, and factor them into calculation.\n",
      "* Metaphor: rewrite the task using a metaphor, to disambiguate the concepts and have a more in-depth understanding of the task\n",
      "* Critical Thinking: analyze the problem from different perspectives or questioning assumptions, and evaluate the evidence or information available.\n",
      "* Creative Thinking: generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.\n",

      "  \"adapted_modules\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\\n   - House number (1 to 5)\\n   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\\n   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\\n   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\\n   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\\n   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\\n   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints.

      "  \"adapted_modules\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\\n   - House number (1 to 5)\\n   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\\n   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\\n   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\\n   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\\n   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\\n   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints. This framework should:\\n   - Allow for the elimination of impossible configurations\\n   - Enable the derivation of new information from existing data\\n   This will help in systematically narrowing down possibilities.\\n\\n7. **Solution Validation and Consistency Check**: Implement a robust validation process to ensure that the final configuration adheres to all constraints. This should include:\\n   - Cross-referencing each attribute against the constraints\\n   - Ensuring that all relationships are satisfied\\n   - Confirming that the solution is unique and consistent with the problem requirements\\n   This validation step is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer to the question of who drinks water.\\n\\nBy refining these reasoning modules, we can create a more structured and efficient approach to solving the task, ultimately leading to a clearer identification of who drinks water.\",\n",

      "  \"adapted_modules\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\\n   - House number (1 to 5)\\n   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\\n   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\\n   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\\n   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\\n   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\\n   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints. This framework should:\\n   - Allow for the elimination of impossible configurations\\n   - Enable the derivation of new information from existing data\\n   This will help in systematically narrowing down possibilities.\\n\\n7. **Solution Validation and Consistency Check**: Implement a robust validation process to ensure that the final configuration adheres to all constraints. This should include:\\n   - Cross-referencing each attribute against the constraints\\n   - Ensuring that all relationships are satisfied\\n   - Confirming that the solution is unique and consistent with the problem requirements\\n   This validation step is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer to the question of who drinks water.\\n\\nBy refining these reasoning modules, we can create a more structured and efficient approach to solving the task, ultimately leading to a clearer identification of who drinks water.\",\n",

      "  \"adapted_modules\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\\n   - House number (1 to 5)\\n   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\\n   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\\n   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\\n   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\\n   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\\n   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints. This framework should:\\n   - Allow for the elimination of impossible configurations\\n   - Enable the derivation of new information from existing data\\n   This will help in systematically narrowing down possibilities.\\n\\n7. **Solution Validation and Consistency Check**: Implement a robust validation process to ensure that the final configuration adheres to all constraints. This should include:\\n   - Cross-referencing each attribute against the constraints\\n   - Ensuring that all relationships are satisfied\\n   - Confirming that the solution is unique and consistent with the problem requirements\\n   This validation step is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer to the question of who drinks water.\\n\\nBy refining these reasoning modules, we can create a more structured and efficient approach to solving the task, ultimately leading to a clearer identification of who drinks water.\",\n",

      "  \"adapted_modules\": \"To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\\n\\n1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\\n   - House number (1 to 5)\\n   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\\n   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\\n   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\\n   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\\n   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\\n   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\\n\\n2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints. This framework should:\\n   - Allow for the elimination of impossible configurations\\n   - Enable the derivation of new information from existing data\\n   This will help in systematically narrowing down possibilities.\\n\\n7. **Solution Validation and Consistency Check**: Implement a robust validation process to ensure that the final configuration adheres to all constraints. This should include:\\n   - Cross-referencing each attribute against the constraints\\n   - Ensuring that all relationships are satisfied\\n   - Confirming that the solution is unique and consistent with the problem requirements\\n   This validation step is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer to the question of who drinks water.\\n\\nBy refining these reasoning modules, we can create a more structured and efficient approach to solving the task, ultimately leading to a clearer identification of who drinks water.\",\n",

Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\\n   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\\n   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\\n   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\\n\\n4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\\n   - Direct constraints (e.g., \\\"The Englishman lives in the red house\\\")\\n   - Positional constraints (e.g., \\\"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\\\")\\n   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \\\"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\\\")\\n   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\\n\\n5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\\n   - Generating permutations of the attributes\\n   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\\n   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\\n\\n6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints.

      "To enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning module for solving the task of determining who drinks water, we can reformulate and specify the modules as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Structure Development**: Design a comprehensive data structure (e.g., a matrix or a list of dictionaries) that encapsulates all relevant attributes for each house, including:\n",
      "   - House number (1 to 5)\n",
      "   - Color (red, green, ivory, yellow, blue)\n",
      "   - Nationality (Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese)\n",
      "   - Drink (coffee, tea, milk, orange juice, water)\n",
      "   - Cigarette brand (Old Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, Parliament)\n",
      "   - Pet (dog, snails, fox, horse, no pet)\n",
      "   This structure should allow for easy access and manipulation of data to facilitate reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Actor Identification and Role Analysis**: Clearly identify the five residents (actors) and their unique attributes. Analyze how each resident's characteristics (nationality, drink, cigarette, pet) interact with one another, focusing on their roles in the context of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Comprehensive Relationship Mapping**: Create a detailed mapping of all relationships and constraints between the actors. This includes:\n",
      "   - Direct relationships (e.g., who lives next to whom)\n",
      "   - Indirect relationships (e.g., implications of one attribute on another)\n",
      "   This mapping should visually represent how each attribute is interconnected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Constraint Identification and Organization**: Systematically list and categorize all constraints provided in the problem statement. This should include:\n",
      "   - Direct constraints (e.g., \"The Englishman lives in the red house\")\n",
      "   - Positional constraints (e.g., \"The green house is immediately to the left of the ivory house\")\n",
      "   - Neighboring constraints (e.g., \"The man who smokes Chesterfield lives next to the man with the fox\")\n",
      "   This organization will facilitate quick reference and application during the reasoning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Scenario Exploration and Simulation**: Develop a systematic approach to explore various configurations of the houses based on the constraints. This could involve:\n",
      "   - Generating permutations of the attributes\n",
      "   - Testing each permutation against the constraints to identify valid configurations\n",
      "   This simulation should be iterative, allowing for backtracking when inconsistencies arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Formal Logical Deduction System**: Establish a structured logical framework that applies formal reasoning techniques (e.g., propositional logic, deduction rules) to derive conclusions from the constraints. This framework should:\n",
      "   - Allow for the elimination of impossible configurations\n",
      "   - Enable the derivation of new information from existing data\n",
      "   This will help in systematically narrowing down possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Solution Validation and Consistency Check**: Implement a robust validation process to ensure that the final configuration adheres to all constraints. This should include:\n",
      "   - Cross-referencing each attribute against the constraints\n",
      "   - Ensuring that all relationships are satisfied\n",
      "   - Confirming that the solution is unique and consistent with the problem requirements\n",
      "   This validation step is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer to the question of who drinks water.\n",
      "\n",
      "By refining these reasoning modules, we can create a more structured and efficient approach to solving the task, ultimately leading to a clearer identification of who drinks water.\n"
